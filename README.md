# fdf-nintendoswitch
Nintendo Switch port of my 42 wireframe graphics project


# to add
I still need to port over the map opening system. My plan is to scan a defined directory "fdf_maps" and make an array of maps that can be toggled between.

# dependencies

pacman

devkitpro and its switch packages, this will include libnx (see the devkitpro switch install instructions)
